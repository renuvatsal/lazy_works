# This is a basic workflow to help you get started with Actions

name: CI

# Controls when the workflow will run
on:
  # Triggers the workflow on push or pull request events but only for the "main" branch

  # Allows you to run this workflow manually from the Actions tab
  workflow_dispatch:

# A workflow run is made up of one or more jobs that can run sequentially or in parallel
jobs:
  # This workflow contains a single job called "build"
  build:
    # The type of runner that the job will run on
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    # GitHub Actions jobs time out after 6 hours by default. 
    # Your script's 3-minute retry loop will work well within this limit.
    timeout-minutes: 360

    # Steps represent a sequence of tasks that will be executed as part of the job
    steps:
     # Step 1: Checks out your repository's code so the runner can access it.
      - name: Check out repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v4

      # Step 2: Sets up the specified version of Python.
      - name: Set up Python 3.10
        uses: actions/setup-python@v5
        with:
          python-version: '3.10'

      # Step 3: Installs the necessary Python packages.
      # This step requires a 'requirements.txt' file in your repository.
      - name: Install dependencies
        run: |
          python -m pip install --upgrade pip
          pip install -r requirements.txt

      # Step 4: Runs your Python script.
      # It securely injects your credentials and settings from GitHub Secrets 
      # into the script as environment variables.
